                <h2>Kell Golden</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm an aspiring Product Manager that is looking for an opportunity to solve the world's 
                    most complex problems using cool products. Moreover, I desire to use my professional 
                    experiences to socially innovate the way businesses and teams operate, through the lens 
                    of creativity, diversity, and integrity. 
                    
                    After being in campus ministry for 5 years, I decided to make a career pivot towards working 
                    with disrupting technologies as a Product Manager. Knowing then, that I lacked the skills and 
                    knowledge in this field, I volunteered and freelanced at multiple start-ups and tech companies 
                    to gain some product-related experiences.

                    Due to my efforts wearing multiple hats in this ecosystem, I was able to grow in empathy. 
                    Working cross-functionally, gave me an intimate view of what intrinsically motivates team 
                    members (words of affirmation, great communication, full-transparency – even if it's inconvenient). 

                    In previous roles, working on many agile development teams as either a product marketer, 
                    software trainer, or business developer, I have had the opportunity to create user web-flows 
                    for new product releases and have created software training processes that increased operational 
                    workflow by 50%. 

                    Currently, I am maximizing my time to do the following:

                    1. Building web platforms with Code for America, to assist professionals that have been incarcerated.
                    2. Substitute teaching at Purdue Polytechnic to help teens utilize technology to grow professionally.
                    3. Participating in coding boot camps and enrolling in coding courses, to become more familiar with 
                    the different UI architectures developers use. 

                    Understanding these different tools, as a PM, helps me to appropriately assign epics I know their 
                    developing platforms are used to creating.

                    As an aspiring PM, I am excited to implement my love for user-strategy, process development, and 
                    team building as a Product Manager. 

                    What I enjoy doing in my spare time and would love to have conversations about:
                    1. Basketball & vocal training
                    2. Watching anime
                    3. Fashion designs
                    4. Learning new words
                    5. Singing
                    6. Solving Rubik's cubes (90 seconds) 
                    7. Creating apps to solve community issues
