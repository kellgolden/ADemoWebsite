                    After being in campus ministry for 5 years, I decided to make a career pivot towards working 
                    with disrupting technologies as a Product Manager. Knowing then, that I lacked the skills and 
                    knowledge in this field, I volunteered and freelanced at multiple start-ups and tech companies 
                    to gain some product-related experiences.

                    Due to my efforts wearing multiple hats in this ecosystem, I was able to grow in empathy. 
                    Working cross-functionally, gave me an intimate view of what intrinsically motivates team 
                    members (words of affirmation, great communication, full-transparency â€“ even if it's inconvenient)...
